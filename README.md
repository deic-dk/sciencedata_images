# sciencedata_images

Dockerfile recipes and associated files to build a basic collection of images for the [ScienceData Kubernetes service](https://github.com/deic-dk/sciencedata_kubernetes) and the associated [Kubernetes app](https://github.com/deic-dk/user_pods) on [ScienceData](https://sciencedata.dk/).

The images are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sciencedata).

Users are encouraged to add to the collection by extending the provided images or directly using images from Docker Hub.
